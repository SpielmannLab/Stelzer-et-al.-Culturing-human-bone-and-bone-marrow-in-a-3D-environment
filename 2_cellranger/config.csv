filter-probes,true,,,# Include all non-deprecated probes listed in the probe set reference CSV file. Probes that are predicted to have off-target activity to homologous genes are excluded from analysis by default. Setting filter-probes to false will result in UMI counts from all non-deprecated probes, including those with predicted off-target activity, to be used in the analysis. Probes whose ID is prefixed with DEPRECATED are always excluded from the analysis. Default: true. Optional.
no-bam,false,,,# Disables BAM(.bai) file generation, saving disk space at the expense of interrogable alignment records. Default: false.
