# Parameters for the pipeline

# Merging or Integration
task: "integrate-seurat"       # Choose: merge, integrate-seurat, integrate-harmony
integrate_seurat_algorithm: "cca" # [optional] Default cca. Choose from cca,rpca, or <blank>. Use rpca for large datasets and large number of samples to integrate
method: "standard"              # Choose: standard or SCT, Use the same method used to process single sample if task = "integrate-seurat"
project: "astrocytes" # Name of the merged or integrated dataset. Used to name output file. No "_" allowed
nhvg: 2500                      # Number of relevant features. Used for all three tasks
npcs: 30                        # Required only for integrate-seurat or integrate-harmony. Number of PCs.
nclust: 40                        # Required only for integrate-harmony
reference:                     # [optional] The # of the sample(s) to be used as the reference during integration. Used only for task integrate-seurat, Provide comma seperated values if you have more than 1 reference. Leave it empty if not inegrating with reference
integrateBy: "orig.ident"         # Only for integrate-harmony task and for integrate-seurat task (when method is "standard"). This is usually "orig.ident", "group", or "replicate", but can be any other metadata names.
sampleTree:                     # [optional, Advanced syntax] Specify the order of integration for integrate-seurat
covars:                         # [optional] Which metadata to regress out? Comma separated. Used for all tasks
